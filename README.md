Entire text-based game library with some utility tools written in Typescript. Which manages player interactions primarily turns and varying forms of combat ideally aiding in the development of text-based games. Much of the functionality matches a small scale game engine. Given usually only large-scale game engines provide this sort of functionality partially due to the difficulty of implementing such.

## Coming Soon

I'll likely shove it into a npm package.

## Contributing
Contribution is fine, just make sure a issue is opened if you plan on making major changes to discuss what you would like to change.

Updating the tests as needed is expected to avoid breaking current functionality.
